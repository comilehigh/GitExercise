Caleb had a little lamb,
whose fleece was white as snow.

And everywhere that Caleb went,
the lamb was sure to go.
 
It followed him to school one day
which was against the rules.

It made the children laugh and play,
to see a lamb at school.

And so the teacher turned it out,
but still it lingered near,

And waited patiently about,
till Caleb did appear.

“Why does the lamb love Caleb so?”
the eager children cry.

“Why, Caleb loves the lamb, you know.”
the teacher did reply
